Research-Scale Generation Training Experiment
============================================
Training GPT-2 with stratified components on research-scale datasets:
- Wikipedia (structured factual text)
- BookCorpus-style data (long-form narrative)
- StackExchange (Q&A reasoning)
- arXiv abstracts (technical writing)

The field was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and has experienced several waves of optimism and disappointment. Modern AI techniques include machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks, which have achieved remarkable success in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.",
        "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate variations occur naturally, scientific evidence shows that human activities have been the primary driver of climate change since the 1800s. The burning of fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that trap heat in Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming.",
        "Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scale. Unlike classical physics, quantum mechanics reveals that energy, momentum, and other quantities are often restricted to discrete values, and that particles can exhibit wave-like properties.",

The villagers had learned to read the language of the trees, understanding the subtle signs that warned of changing seasons and approaching weather.",

First, consider using vectorized operations with NumPy or Pandas instead of loops. Second, implement caching for expensive computations using functools.lru_cache. Third, consider using multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks or asyncio for I/O-bound operations.",
        "Question: What's the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? Answer: Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, like classification or regression tasks. Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labels, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction. Semi-supervised learning combines both approaches when you have limited labeled data.",
        "Question: How does blockchain technology ensure security? Answer: Blockchain security relies on cryptographic hashing, distributed consensus, and immutability. Each block contains a hash of the previous block, creating a chain that's extremely difficult to alter. The distributed nature means no single point of failure, and consensus mechanisms ensure all participants agree on the state of the ledger.",
        "Question: What are the key principles of good software architecture? Answer: Good software architecture follows several key principles: separation of concerns, modularity, loose coupling, high cohesion, and the single responsibility principle. It should be scalable, maintainable, testable, and well-documented. The architecture should also consider performance, security, and deployment requirements.",
        "Question: How do neural networks learn from data? Answer: Neural networks learn through a process called backpropagation, which adjusts the weights and biases of connections between neurons based on the error between predicted and actual outputs. The network makes predictions, calculates loss, and then propagates the error backward through the layers to update parameters using gradient descent optimization.",
