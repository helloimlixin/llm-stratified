# Alternative Stratified Manifold Approaches - BREAKTHROUGH RESULTS

## üöÄ **Experiment Overview**

**Objective**: Explore alternative ways to leverage stratified manifold concepts for LLM improvement, avoiding the failed geometric regularization approach.

**Approach**: Instead of geometric regularization, implement stratified mechanisms in:
1. **Attention Mechanisms** - Route tokens to different attention heads based on manifold structure
2. **Token Routing** - Route tokens to different processing paths
3. **Layer Processing** - Use different processing strategies for different layers
4. **Mixture-of-Experts** - Stratified expert routing

**Dataset**: Real multidomain sentiment datasets (IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Amazon, SST-2)
**Model**: DistilBERT (66M parameters)
**Training**: 3 epochs with proper train/validation/test splits
