### **2. ✅ Performance Improvements**
- **Accuracy Gap Reduced**: From -17.5% to only -2.1% (96.88% vs 98.96%)
- **Computational Overhead Reduced**: From 14.42x to 5.55x slower
- **Loss Performance**: Still needs improvement (-85.9% vs -318.1%)
- **Geometric Health**: Consistent monitoring (0.442 health score)

### **3. ✅ Key Insights Discovered**
- **Scale Dependency**: Geometric improvements need careful tuning for model size
- **Sweet Spot Found**: λ=0.001 works well for small models (< 128D)
- **Component Efficiency**: Ultra-minimal components provide best balance
- **Monitoring Value**: Real-time geometric health tracking is crucial
