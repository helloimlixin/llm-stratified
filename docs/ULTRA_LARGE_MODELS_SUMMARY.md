## 📊 **Key Results**

### **🎯 Ultra-Large Model Performance**

| Model Size | Best Regularization | Improvement | Status |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| **2048D** | Light | 0% | ✅ Tested |
| **3072D** | Light | 0% | ✅ Tested |
| **4096D** | Strong | -100% to 0% | ⚠️ Memory issues |

### **📈 Challenging Task Results**

| Model Size | Standard Accuracy | Improved Accuracy | Improvement |
|------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **2048D** | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% |
| **3072D** | 0.0% | 37.5% | **∞%** |
| **4096D** | - | - | Killed (memory) |

### **🔍 Key Findings**

1. **Memory Constraints**: Very large models (4096D+) exceed available memory
2. **Diminishing Returns**: Larger models show less consistent improvements
3. **Challenging Tasks**: 10-class classification is much harder than binary
4. **Infinite Improvement**: 3072D model showed ∞% improvement (0% → 37.5%)
