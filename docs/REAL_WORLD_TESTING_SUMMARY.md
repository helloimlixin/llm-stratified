- **Simplified Components**: Use only essential geometric components
- **Faster Monitoring**: Reduce monitoring frequency

### **2. For Medium Models (512D-1024D):**
- **Moderate Regularization**: Use Œª_strata=0.05, Œª_curvature=0.02
- **Selective Components**: Choose most beneficial geometric improvements
- **Balanced Monitoring**: Regular but not excessive monitoring

### **3. For Large Models (> 1024D):**
- **Full Regularization**: Use Œª_strata=0.1, Œª_curvature=0.05
- **All Components**: Implement complete geometric enhancement suite
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Full geometric health tracking

### **4. For Production Use:**
- **Start Conservative**: Begin with light regularization
- **Monitor Closely**: Watch geometric health during training
- **Scale Gradually**: Increase regularization as model size grows
- **Task-Specific Tuning**: Adjust for specific downstream tasks
