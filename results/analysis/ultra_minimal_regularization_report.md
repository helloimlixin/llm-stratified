## 💡 Recommendations

### ⚠️ Even Lighter Regularization Needed
- Try λ_strata=0.0005, λ_curvature=0.0005
- Consider removing some geometric components entirely
- Focus only on most essential geometric improvements
- May need task-specific tuning

### For Very Small Models (< 128D):
- Use λ_strata=0.001, λ_curvature=0.001, λ_manifold=0.0005
- Implement only essential geometric components
- Monitor computational overhead closely
- Focus on minimal geometric improvements
