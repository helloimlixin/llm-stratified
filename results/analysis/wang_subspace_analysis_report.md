## Based on Wang et al. (2025)

### ðŸ“Š Attention Subspace Analysis

- **Total Dimensions**: 768
- **Active Dimensions**: 367
- **Directions Percentage**: 47.8%
- **Variance Threshold**: 99.0%

### ðŸ’€ Dead Features Analysis

- **Total Features**: 768
- **Dead Features**: 77
- **Dead Percentage**: 10.0%
- **Aligned Dead Rate**: 4.7%
- **Misaligned Dead Rate**: 15.4%

### ðŸ§  Theoretical Implications

Based on Wang et al. (2025) findings:

1. **Low-Dimensional Subspaces**: Attention outputs are confined to surprisingly low-dimensional subspaces
2. **60% Rule**: About 60% of directions account for 99% of variance
3. **Dead Features**: Low-rank structure causes dead features in sparse dictionary learning
4. **Subspace Constraints**: Subspace-constrained training reduces dead features significantly

### Implications for Stratified Manifold Learning:

1. **Subspace-Aware MoE**: Design MoE architectures that respect attention subspaces
2. **Dead Feature Prevention**: Use subspace constraints in sparse dictionary learning
3. **Layer-Specific Analysis**: Account for subspace evolution across layers
4. **Geometric Regularization**: Add subspace constraints to training

### ðŸ’¡ Recommendations

1. **Subspace-Constrained Training**: Initialize features in active subspaces
2. **Dead Feature Monitoring**: Track dead features during training
3. **Layer-Aware Processing**: Account for subspace differences across layers
4. **Geometric Integration**: Combine with stratified manifold analysis
